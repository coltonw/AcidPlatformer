# AcidPlatformer

This is a simple javascript platformer that may evolve over time to be something more.

## To do

 * Convert from EaselJS to the latest hotness. [Pixi.js possibly?](http://www.pixijs.com/)
 * Move from grunt to gulp.
 * Restyle js to be 2 spaces instead of 4.
 * Possibly use a cdn instead of pulling all the libs in.
